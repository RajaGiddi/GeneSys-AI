## Poetry

To run this project, you need to use the [Poetry package manager](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), then you can run `brew install poetry`.

## Running locally

Create a `.env` file containing varibles required to run the application (e.g., your OpenAI API key).

TODO: point to the environment variable validation logic instead of enumerating the required variables here.
