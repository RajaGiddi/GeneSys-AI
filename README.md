# Bioinformatics
This is my attempt at learning Bioinformatics using Python and solving the Rosalind problems


# Day 1: MCAT Biochemistry Review + Some Code

## Completed:
- Validating and Counting the number of nucleotides in a DNA string
- Transcription: Essentially transcribing a DNA seq to it's RNA version
- Reverse Complementary Strands: Finds the complement strand and reverses it
- GC Content: Computes the GC content of a given strand (COME BACK)

# Day 2: Busy Day
## Completed:
- GC Content: Computes the GC content of a given strand.
    - Solved the Rosalind problem code that finds the maximum GC content of a given FASTA file
- Translation: Given a DNA sequence, translate it into it's respective AA sequence

# Day 3: Becoming more Algorithm based Problems
 ## Completed
 - Calculate the Protein Mass of a given protein sequence
 - Calculating Point Mutations: Wrote a function that calculates the hamming distance between two DNA sequences
