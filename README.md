# DecodeAI

DecodeAI is an innovative and versatile tool designed to empower bioinformaticians, researchers, clinicians, and students in their genomics and bioinformatics endeavors. This chatbot harnesses the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to provide a user-friendly, conversational interface for a wide range of genomic analysis tasks.

## Key Features:

FASTA File Processing: Users can easily upload FASTA files containing DNA or protein sequences for various analytical tasks.

FASTA File Processing: Users can easily upload FASTA files containing DNA or protein sequences for various analytical tasks.

Genomic Processing: The chatbot offers an extensive suite of bioinformatics functions, including:

Sequence translation: Converts DNA sequences into protein sequences.
Transcription: Transcribes DNA sequences into RNA sequences.
Restriction site detection: Identifies reverse palindromic DNA sequences, often indicating potential cutting sites for restriction enzymes.
Multiple Sequence Alignment: Aligns multiple sequences for comparative analysis.
SNP detection: Detects Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA sequences.
Primer Design Automation: Automates the design of primers for PCR experiments.
BLAST searches: Implements various BLAST algorithms for sequence similarity searches.
